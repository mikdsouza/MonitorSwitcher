# MonitorSwitcher
Adding a custom GUI to an existing monitor switcher app

Extension of Monitor Project in here
http://sourceforge.net/projects/monitorswitcher/

The same functionality except in a win forms GUI. I personally couldn't get the hotkeys in that app to work in windows 10, so I made my own program with differently implemented hotkeys.


## New Features
* The winforms GUI shows the hotkeys on the form along with the profile

## Upcoming Small Features
* Ability to rename profiles
* Ability to reorder profiles
* Ability to reset all profiles

## Upcoming Big Features
* Ability to Minimise to tray and operate from a context menu
* Ability to save entire profiles in app data and not separately
